# Self-Driving-Car-Using-RasberryPi
  This project demonstrates the implementation of an autonomous car that can recognize traffic signs and respond accordingly. The car uses a Raspberry Pi as the main controller and a camera module to capture images of traffic signs. The images are then processed using computer vision techniques to identify the signs and determine the necessary actions.
